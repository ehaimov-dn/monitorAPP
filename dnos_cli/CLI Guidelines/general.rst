Every help line has two columns: the left column lists the parameters/menu items; the right column provides a help description.

"Menu items" refers to static text that is entered verbatim. Example: mpls

"Parameters" refers to variables (dynamic). Example: <vrf_name>

"Help descriptions" refers to the help line for each menu item or parameter.
