show bgp neighbors
------------------

**Minimum user role:** viewer

The following command displays detailed information on BGP neighbor connections:

**Command syntax: show bgp** {instance vrf [vrf-name]} [address-family] [sub-address-family] **neighbors** {[neighbor-address] {routes \| dampened-routes \| flap-statistics \| prefix-counts \| received-orf}}

**Command mode:** operational


..
	**Internal Note**

	- use vrf to display information for a non-default vrf

	- for non-default instance vrf support only "unicast" sub-address-family

	- routes - Display routes learned from neighbor

	- dampened-routes - Display the dampened routes received from neighbor

	- flap-statistics - Display flap statistics of the routes learned from neighbor

	- prefix-count - Display detailed prefix count information

	- received-orf - Display received ORF prefix-lists from ORF capable neighbor (supported only for "unicast" sub-address-family)

	- advertised-routes, received-routes, routes, dampened-routes, received-orf \| flap-statistics \| prefix-counts - can only be set with a specific neighbor address

	- for BGP NSR capable sessions, BGP NSR last recovery status will present:

	-  recoved - last BGP NSR s/o has been done successfully

	-  not recoved - last BGP NSR s/o has been failed, fallback to BGP GR will be done if GR is enabled

	-  N/A - no BGP NSR s/o has happened yet
