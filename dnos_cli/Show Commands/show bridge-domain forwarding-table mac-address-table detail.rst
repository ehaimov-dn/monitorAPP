**Command syntax: show bridge-domain forwarding-table mac-address-table detail** {ncp [ncp-id]}
**Command syntax: show bridge-domain forwarding-table mac-address-table detail** instance [bridge-domain-name] {ncp [ncp-id]}
**Command syntax: show bridge-domain forwarding-table mac-address-table detail** mac [mac-address] {ncp [ncp-id]}


**Command mode:** operational

**Parameter table:**

| Parameter          | Description                             | Values            | Default value |
+====================+=========================================+===================+===============+
| bridge-domain-name | The name of the Bridge Domain           | String | all      | \-            |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------------+
| ncp-id             | The ID of the NCP for which to display  | 0..255 characters | \-            |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------------+
| mac-address        | A specific mac-address                  | xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx | \-            |
+--------------------+-----------------------------------------+-------------------+---------------+

**Note:**

- Specifying a bridge-domain-name will display the specified Bridge-Domain's mac-addresses

- Specifying 'all' will result in the listing of the mac addresses of all BDs

- Specifying a MAC Address will provide the details of that MAC address if it is found in the MAC table of a Bridge Domain.

- Specifying an ncp-id will provide the information from the specified NCP.
