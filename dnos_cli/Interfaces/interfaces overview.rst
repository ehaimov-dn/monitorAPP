Interfaces Overview
-------------------
DNOS supports a highly modular range of high-speed Ethernet interfaces in a wide range of speeds, as follows.

- 1 GbE
- 10 GbE
- 25 GbE
- 40 GbE
- 100 GbE
- 400 GbE

This solution requires fewer physical interconnects, accelerating provisioning and reducing deployment and sparing costs.

The following types of interfaces are available for user provisioning:

- High-speed Physical Interfaces
- Link Aggregation Group Interfaces (Bundle Interfaces)
- Loopback Interfaces
- Sub-interfaces
- GRE-tunnel Interface
- Interface Naming Conventions
- Configure Interfaces
- Show Config Interfaces
- Interfaces Displaying Information
- Clear Interfaces Counters
- Clear Interfaces Dampening Penalty
