interfaces revertive
--------------------

**Minimum user role:** operator

When a bundle is configured with max-links (N out of M), N ports are determined as active, the rest as standby.
If an active port is down, a standby port is selected instead.
You can set the revertive behavior for when a higher port-priority member becomes available.
When enabled, when that higher port-priority link becomes operational or a link is added to the aggregated interface that is determined to be higher in priority, it takes precedence over a standby port currently active in the bundle.
To configure revertive behavior:

**Command syntax: revertive [admin-state]**

**Command mode:** config

**Hierarchies**

- interfaces

**Note**

- The command is applicable to bundle interfaces.

- If LACP is not enabled, the revertive configuration must be identical on both ends of the bundle link to prevent misaligned active ports.
