interfaces max-links
--------------------

**Minimum user role:** operator

Set the maximum number of interface members that can be active for the aggregate interface (bundle) at a given time.
Interface members are selected to be active according to their port-priority configuration.
An interface member not selected to be active in the aggregate interface will be in standby and will not pass traffic. In case an active member fails, a standby member will be used.
The max-link configuration is independent of LACP configuration.
If LACP is not enabled, the max-link configuration must be identical on both ends of the bundle link.
If LACP is enabled, the LACP state-machine takes precedence over the LAG selection mechanism.
To configure the maximum number of active links in the bundle interface:

**Command syntax: max-links [max-links]**

**Command mode:** config

**Hierarchies**

- interfaces

**Note**

- The command is applicable to bundle interfaces.

- Max-links must be greater or equal to min-links. Commit validation expected
